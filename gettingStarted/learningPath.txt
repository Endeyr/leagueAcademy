  Welcome to League Academy. This is our curated learning path to help you improve at league. 

  This is a self-paced guide to help our community start their improvement journey. While this guide is aiming at new players, we think it will be helpful to those of all experience and elo. Take a look at each section at your own convenience, ask questions when you feel stuck, and most of all have fun!

Not everything in the guide will be 100% agreed upon best practice but instead curated information aimed at a general new player.
