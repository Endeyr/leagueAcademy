**__Champion Mastery__**

Champion Mastery Guide for Soloq. 

When exploring a matchup, break it down into its simplest parts. You are taking what was talked about in the Champion section and applying to to both sides (in the case of bot lane, 4 sides). This won't go in depth on matchup specifics (there are too many for anyone to know everything about) but instead aim to be the foundation (like many other parts of the guide if you sense a theme) for your improvement. First lets break it down. 

**Matchup Breakdown:**
  Base stats (effective health / dmg)
  Atk range 
  Atk spd 
  Abilities 
  Skill range 
  Cds (basic combos)
  Resources (health / mana)
  Summoner spells
  Items 
  Runes 

The above is everything that goes into a matchup (minus that pesky jungler or support roam). Going into the matchup you should know or at least have a very good idea of how your champion works in relation to that table. Then all you have to do is know the same for the opponent champion and abuse your advantages! See its super easy! Well actually there is lots of depth to concept but to help you out lets look at an example. 

Eg. Darius vs Kayle ; patch 12.10

Insert wr + stats@15
Insert base stats + scaling
Insert basic combos + dmg amts
Lv + item breakpoints

**Misplay vs Misinformed:**
  Misplay -> Mechanical. 

  Misinformed -> Incorrect assumptions, lack of knowledge, lack of understanding, missing or incorrect technical knowledge. 

This distinction tells you helps you find direction when correcting mistakes. If you lost a 1v1 vs a Riven, knowing it was a misplay means you need to practice your mechanics more while if you were misinformed then it means there is something about the matchup, or Riven, or your champion that you don't understand and you need to do more research into the topic. 

Another tip is if you aren't sure you can 1v1 someone, check level > items > resources. Most champs can't win 1v1 if down in levels or items. 

**Gameplan:** 
Once you know your champion and have an idea of how the other champion wants to play, it's time to develop a gameplan. Create a gameplan for how to play if you are ahead, even, and behind. Make one for if you get camped by the jungler or if your jungler camps for you. Preparing for these situations ahead of time allows you to not panic in game as well as have a frame of reference for reviewing your gameplay. After the game you can compare how the game went with your plan. If you are stuck after that then it makes it 100x easier on a coach to help you because you will know exactly what you are asking for help on as well as have a game to support it and before / after information. 

**Next Steps:**
  Now that you have an understanding of your champion(s) and matchups, its time to pick your next path. While I think it's helpful for everyone to start with the lane path, if you are not a top or mid you can go to your designated section. 

  Top + Mid Laners -> <lane>
  Junglers -> <jungle>
  ADC -> <adc>
  Support -> <support>
