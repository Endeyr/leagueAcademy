How to Play a Matchup in League, General Guide for New Players. 

When exploring a matchup, break it down into its simplest parts. You are taking what was talked about in the Champion section and applying to to both sides (in the case of bot lane, 4 sides). This won't go in depth on matchup specifics (there are too many for anyone to know everything about) but instead aim to be the foundation (like many other parts of the guide if you sense a theme) for your improvement. First lets break it down. 

Matchup Breakdown:
Base stats (effective health / dmg)
Atk range 
Atk spd 
Abilities 
Skill range 
Cds (basic combos)
Resources (health / mana)
Ss 
Items 
Runes 

The above is everything that goes into a matchup (minus that pesky jungler or support roam). Going into the matchup you should know or at least have a very good idea of how your champion works in relation to that table. Then all you have to do is know the same for the opponent champion and abuse your advantages! See its super easy! Well actually there is alot of depth to concept but to help you out lets look at an example. 

Eg. Darius vs Kayle ; patch 12.10

Insert wr + stats@15
Insert base stats + scaling
Insert basic combos + dmg amts
Lv + item breakpoints

Misplay vs Misinformed:
  

Teamfight roles: 

  put this somewhere 
If you aren't sure you can 1v1 someone, check level > items > resources.
Most champs can't win 1v1 if down in levels or items. 
Have a gameplan for how to lose
