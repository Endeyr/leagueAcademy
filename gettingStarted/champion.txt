**__Champion__**

This section of the guide will help you pick a champion(s), better understand the champion(s) you play, and your role in the game. It is intended to be the foundation of which you can build a better understanding.

**Picking Your Champions**
  Players will often ask, "should I play x, y, or z. q is strong but not in meta. I don't like w but hes meta...ect ect" and my response is always "play what you enjoy." Part of that is because at the end of the day, this is a game and you should enjoy playing it. But also you are more likely to put the time in required to learn a champion to its max if you truly enjoy playing the champion. I enjoy Wukong, so putting in 20 games of the monkey is easy. If I tried to do that with Warwick I would never make it past 3 games. League is a large time sink, that time sink isn't worth it for everyone but that's the reality of it. If you want to be good at it you need to put the time in and make sure you are making good use of the time you put in by having focus. 

  If you still aren't sure what to play or where to start then look at the most played champions on <u.gg> or your preferred league site. Win rate here doesn't matter much, sort by play rate, and make a list of each champion from the top 10 most played that you think you'd enjoy, and what you like about them. Now cut this list down to 6 and write down what you don't like about the remaining. Now cut down to how many champions you plan to play or would like to learn. Remember its easier and faster to learn 1 champion at a time than trying to learn multiple champions. 

**know your champion:**
  passive
  ability
  ability order
  ability power spikes
  combos
  core runes
  situational runes
  core items
  situational items
  item buy timings

Go into practice tool as your "main" champion (or look on the wiki). This can be one you play the most, one you want to learn, ect. Actually read your passive. Think about and understand what it does. Read each ability in the same way. Note the base damages, the ratios, the damage type, cooldown, mana cost, ect. You'd be surprised how little people know about the champion they play. 

**Gameplan:**
  With this information you can now begin to build a gameplan of how you want to play each part of the game. Start simple by writing down how you want to play laning (early game), mid-game, and teamfights. For example, on Syndra I know I am a midrange mage so early game I have a plan for if they are shorter range than me (harass) or longer range than me (avoid harass) and at lv 6 I can kill by hitting my combo (involves maximizing my ult's damage). For mid game I want to farm to my items catching side waves but not pushing out too far (I have limited mobility). Then in teamfights if I am ahead I play to burst a target, if behind I play to peel ofr my most fed member. This sounds like a lot but once you start doing it for your own champion the knowledge builds upon itself. This foundation allows you to have a plan for every matchup, even if its not a good plan or it doesn't work out. Mistakes are a key part of the learning process. 

**Mistake Categories:** 
  If you are following this guide you now have picked a champion to play, know how the champion is supposed to play, and have made a gameplan to start applying. Now its time to spam some games normals or ranked! (or even bots if you are very new to the game but know the bots don't punish you in the same way.)

  The goal of these games will be to make as many mistakes as possible. That doesn't mean intentionally doing things that you know are wrong but to try out acts or concepts you aren't sure will work but have a solid foundation in your fundamentals knowledge. If this still isn't clear lets go through an example: 
    You are learning Ahri and playing vs Veigar. You think Ahri out trades Veigar early so you take aggressive trades in lane but then get hit by a cage at lv 6 and die. Now in the review you can come to a few conclusions: 1) You may need cleanse in the matchup to avoid the cc. Champions like Veigar, Lux, ect rely on locking you down to burst. 2) You may need to change your runes / itemization for the matchup. Dorans ring vs Corrupting Pot, early merc treds, ect are all things you can adjust. 3) Your assumptions about winning trades is incorrect. Look up the matchup on youtube and watch how they played the matchup vs how you did. What did they do differently / the same and can you incorporate. 
  This can go on and on and has endless depth so lets simplify the process. As a beginner, start with treating every death as a "mistake". This won't be true for all cases as there are "good" deaths but until you can differentiate then treat all as "bad". As a laner, go wave by wave and count the cs you missed, then write down the reason you missed it. Over the course of the game you will notice you are writing down the same or similar reasons. As a jungler, go clear by clear and write down why you chose to gank vs farm (this is the simplified version). Again these reasons will repeat and from that you have something to work from. 

  Now that you have played some and have written down the mistakes you made or your reasoning, its time to start correcting. Google, youtube, discord chats, ect are your friend. Coaching can begin to help at this point. Many coaches (or high elo players) are knowledgeable but don't necessarily have the teaching skills necessary to help, so by having the prepared questions and process you followed you become easy to coach / teach.
