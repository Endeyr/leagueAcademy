**__Adc__**
  The purpose of this guide is to teach you the basic fundamentals of playing adc. Following this will develop a solid foundation for you to improve. This guide is intended for newer players to the role so I will attempt to simplify concepts to the best of my ability. 

**Terminology:**

**General Info:**

**Intro:**
  A solid starting point for the adc role is to know what you actually need to do in the game, Damage! Well kinda, while there are more utility focused adcs (or mages in the bot lane) such as Ashe, at the beginner level it is best to focus primarily on how to actually deal big damage in the role. Your main tools for dealing damage will be gold income and positioning. Without enough gold you will tickle more than do damage, and without good positioning you either will be dead or not in range to do anything.
