**__Jungle__**
  The purpose of this guide is to simplify the role for new players or those new to the role. This is part of League Academy's self-paced curriculum. 

**Terminology:** 
  pathing - the direction of your jungle clear i.e. order you kill your camps. 
  reset - recalling to base to buy items. 
  cross map - the opposite side of the map as the enemy jungler (or opposite the enemy team.)
  gank - walking into a lane. 
  gank path - the exact path you control your character to walk on a gank. 
  invade - entering the enemy jungle. 
  economy - total amount of resources (gold and xp) available. 
  opportunity cost -  loss of potential gain from other alternatives
  
**General Info:** 
  Jungle Camps are generally placed into three categories; monsters, buffs, crabs. 
  Monsters respawn 2m15s after being killed.
  Buffs respawn 5m after  being killed.
  Crabs respawn 2m30s after  being killed.
  
  **Neutral Monsters**
  Dragon respawns 5m after being killed. 
  Baron respawns 6m after being killed. 
  Elder Dragon respawns 6m after being killed.
  
  Jungle camps also have a patience bar. See this video by Phylaris <https://youtu.be/s08ntcz6Deg> for a better understanding of this concept. I won't go into too much detail here because it's beyond the scope of this guide. 
  
**Intro:** 
  Jungle is a simple role to play. Farm your camps efficiently, gank every lane, stop the enemy jungler from ganking your lanes, farm the enemy jungle camps, get every objective, all while being flamed by your teammates, who, by the way, don't play your role!
  
  **TURN OFF CHAT**. It's my belief that you cannot jungle with chat on. Other players love to type to the jungler and nothing they say has any value, it only exists to distract and tilt. Anything that needs to be communicated can be done with pings. Someone blew their flash? Great ping it. Even with chat off you can type to take notes with /notes or just type to yourself. 

  So why play jungle? I think jungle is a very rewarding role to play, with agency and skill expression. So how do we jungle? Refer back to my idiom, kinda. A simpler way to view jungle is 1) clear camps, 2) watch lanes, 3) react & adapt. Let's break those down into more detail, then we will build habits through the assignments.

**1) Clear Camps:** 
  Your camps are the most consistent source of xp and gold as a jungler. The amount of xp and gold you get from your camps varies not just from camp to camp but historically, a patch will change the economy of jungle. As of this writing, a full clear, defined as killing all 6 of your camps, rewards you with level 4 and 570g (plus 20.4g per 10s; starting at 1:50). For example after a full clear at 3:15 you will have est 750g. Each lv 1 crab gives 70g, so after a full clear into double crab around 3:45 game time you will have est 945g. 

  Gameplan:
    Identify your champion's strong levels and items. This is relative to the game but you can simplify it down as a base then adapt from there (we will get to that soon). For example; take Kindred. Strong duelist vs most other junglers so as a base your plan can be to get red (lv 2) and invade enemy jungle. This is a very common Kindred strategy, so a Kindred player may go into the game with this strategy and adjust based on the other champions in the game or how the lv 1 goes. Next, look at Ekko. Ekko needs all 3 of his abilities to gank effectively, in most situations. Ekko is also very strong at lv 6, as an ultimate reliant champion. Therefore, the Ekko player comes into the game with a plan of full clearing (lv 4) and looking for gank opportunities starting at lv 3 (once he clears a full jungle side). After the 1st full clear, the Ekko player has a plan of full clearing again to get lv 6 around 7 minutes. Once lv 6, the player will look to be aggressive to push their lead. As you get better and more comfortable, you can add in your item buys into your plans. For example, 1100g is a very strong spike for many ap junglers as they can buy sorc shoes. So having a plan to get to that gold amount, taking a reset, then looking to gank, invade, or force a fight will make you snowball games more consistently. 

2) Watch Lanes: 
  Having knowledge of your lanes is key to success in the jungle. If you don't know what is happening in the lanes, you can't effectively plan your jungle paths, find free gank opportunities, or even counter jungle / counter gank! This doesn't mean you absolutely need to use F keys to look at lanes but you need to be looking at the minimap and your allies health. This information, while you take your camps, will inform your next moves and as you learn you will become a better jungler and player. 

3a) React:
  You have your gameplan, jungle clear and items / lv spikes, and are watching lanes while you clear. What next? Now you react to what you see on the map. For example, you plan to take 3 camps and get lv 3. While doing so the enemy jungler shows on the opposite side of the map where you are pathing. Now with that information you can freely take his jungle camps or gank a lane without threat of counter gank instead of continuing your planned clear. This punishes the enemy jungler or evens out the trade if he had a successful gank. Failure to capitalize on these opportunities will put you behind in the game. Take risks and learn from them. 

3b) Adapt: 
  As the game progresses, check in with your plan. If you are behind as Talon your game plan may switch from trying to pick someone out to peeling for your fed adc. Your plan to stack dragons might change to getting both heralds as your bot lane dies on repeat. Play to your strong lanes and players and enable your team to snowball. If you have a top Fiora that's 4-0, play around her so she doesn't lose her bounty. The gold the enemy team gains from the bounty is worth more than the camps you took on your bot side. 

**Champion Identity:**
  As you learned in <championMaster>, it is important to play towards your champions strengths and understand their weaknesses. This section will be a short introduction to 3 types of junglers and their role in the game. This will be further expanded in <teamfighting>. 

    1) Gankers:
        Junglers such as Jarvan that excel in applying pressure to lanes through cc or gap close and are usually slower in their clear. Typically looking to out pressure the enemy jungler.

    2) Farmers:
        Junglers such as Karthus that excel in clearing jungle camps quickly. Typically looking to efficiently clear and build a xp lead.

    3) Duelist:
        Junglers such as Xin Zhao that excel in fighting 1v1. Typically looking to pressure the enemy jungler by invading or fighting over neutral objectives such as crab or dragon. 

  Knowing how your champion fits into their role will help you gameplan. Also some champions fit into multiple roles or their role changes depending on the other champions in the game. For example if you are a duelist jungler but lose 1v1 against the enemy jungler, you may need to focus more on ganking or farming. 

**Assignments:** 
  These are self-guided assignments to help you better understand the role. They will take weeks if not months or years to learn and master. It's also good to revisit them as a refresher. 
  
  1) Jungle Clear: 
    Make a list of a few champions you play jungle. On Youtube, search "<insert champion> jungle clear" and find one on the latest patch (be cautious of large buffs or nerfs changing a champions clears). Phylaris is the gold standard <https://www.youtube.com/c/Phylaris>. Watch the video and pay close attention to how the champion auto attacks, moves while hitting the camp (sometimes it's better to stand still vs trying to kite the camp), the ability usage, what ability you take each level depending on your clear (For example at lv 3 Hecarim can take a 2nd pt in Q instead of putting a pt in E if he is doing a full clear since its faster and he isn't planning on ganking). Practice emulating the clear you watched every day, this is something you need to put the reps into and build muscle memory to get better at other parts of the game. 
    
  2) Map Awareness: 
    Once you feel comfortable with clearing the camps, it's time to add the next step; looking at the lanes / minimap. After a few times practicing your clear, you should now have a good feel. Now add in looking at the minimap in between movements. For example if you are playing Jarvan and clearing red buff, a common tactic is to auto the camp 3 times then move back and repeat. During these 3 autos, you don't need to be looking at your character and are free to look at the minimap (or if you can look directly at the lane). Add this to your daily practice from part 1 and build up the muscle memory of looking around the map with your eyes. An extra step some people find helpful is to use a metronome or timer and have it notify you every 15s (build you way to 3s) to look at the minimap (can alternatively look at specific lanes you are pathing towards but this is more complex). 
  
  3) Gank Paths: 
    We have our clear speed optimized, and are looking at the map (and lanes) for information, now what? Great question! Now it's time to refine our gank paths. <insert image of a good vs bad gank path top lane> In this example, we have a "good" and "bad" gank path. Take notice of how the good gank path positions your champion in the direction that the enemy laner would attempt to flee. This is the foundation of a gank and what separates high elo junglers from auto-filled. To practice this concept, go into practice tool vs 3 bots (they should go to each lane) and try different clears and gank paths. Compare how you approach the gank vs what you saw in high elo gameplay or with the above pictures. Ask yourself: Are you cutting off their route to escape? What abilities do I (or my teammate) have to cc? What abilities do they have to escape (is flash up? if you don't know assume yes)? There is endless depth to this concept but that is beyond the scope of this guide. 
  
  4) Mid - Late Game: 
    After laning has ended, many junglers feel lost but it's really quite simple. You either Aram (all one lane) or farm camps (laners usually take side waves). If an objective (dragon, baron, team wants to take a tower) is up then group, otherwise keep farming. There will be times when you want to farm but your team is trying to force something, it's usually better to default to grouping so your team doesn't take a disadvantaged fight. Also refer back to earlier and play around your fed members. To practice, begin by watching a few of your games back starting at the 15m mark. Note how often your camps are available? Did you play around your fed members? Did you group on objectives or when your team grouped? Compare how you play with the high elo vods I've linked elsewhere (or search on youtube). This is also the time in the game where players are caught out and die due to not knowing what to do or forcing in bad spots. How many of these deaths do you average? How can you cut down on them? Asking yourself good questions helps you improve faster. 
  
  5) Teamfights: 
    Know your role in teamfights but be ready to adapt. As mentioned earlier, your role changes given the gamestate and there is a large learning curve due to how many different ways teamfights can happen. To simplify things, create a plan before you get into the game. What is your champion's ideal role in a teamfight? What is your role when behind? What is your role when ahead? How do these change if the enemy champions are different? Ask yourself these questions and more, write them out (it helps). Practice by watching vods of your champion in teamfights and envision how you would play it vs how they play it. As with gank paths there is endless depth here and this is only scratching the surface. 
    
**Extra Work:** 
  Challenger Jungler Breakdown: 
    Go to <https://www.youtube.com/c/ChallengerReplays/videos> and pick a video of a champion you play. Write a detailed breakdown starting with what you expect their plan to be and why. Take note of their jungle clear, what is happening on the map at each camp of the clear, what exact path they walk for their ganks, how are they reacting and adapting to the game state, how do they play fights, ect. Compare these notes to what you expected pre-game. How are they the same? different? What did you miss? Why did you miss it? Is it a lack of knowledge or understanding? Asking yourself these questions will make you a better player. 

**Next Steps:** 
  As you learn the role YOU WILL MAKE TONS OF MISTAKES AND FALL BEHIND IN THESE GAMES. This is OK AND EXPECTED. The goal isn't to play mistake free but to make many mistakes and learn from them. Fell down 2 lvs to a Master Yi? In the op.gg, look at exactly when you started to fall behind in xp and go to that time in the vod review. Now you can see that you didn't farm any camps for 2 minutes while Yi was able to freely take his entire jungle. 
  
  You've been doing great so far, putting the time in! but, you feel stuck. Now is the time to reflect and write down your current problems or any questions you have. THIS IS WHEN YOU ASK FOR COACHING. Ask questions about the problem, don't just ask for the solution. Know what the problem is, and ask questions that ask why or how the problem occurs. Try to break it down into simpler parts. If you still don't understand then ask for help. 

  Once you feel you are ready, move on to the advanced jungle guide (recommended for D+) or the teamfighting guide.
