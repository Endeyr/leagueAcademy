**__Laning__**
  The purpose of this guide is to simplify the role for new players or those new to the role. This is part of League Academy's self-paced curriculum.

**Terminology:** 
  Lane - refers to top or mid lane (because this is intended for beginners)
  Farming (aka csing) - killing the minions
  Creep Score (cs) - the number of minions, monsters, and champion pets a champion has last hit.
  Last Hitting - slain by dealing the killing blow to these units.
  Trading - interacting with your lane opponent
  Pushing - last hitting the minions at an accelerated rate to push them towards the enemy tower. 
  Crashing - pushing the minions into the enemy tower range.
  Pulling - last hitting the minions at a low health value to keep the wave advancing towards your tower.  
  Holding - last hitting the minions at a low health value to keep the wave from advancing towards the enemy tower. 
  Freezing - holding the minions in one position for multiple waves. 
  Splitting - solo pushing towards the enemy tower. 
  Minion Aggro - the target the minions are auto-attacking. 
  

**General Info:** (don't need to memorize just good to know)
  Every 90 seconds (i. e., every third wave) minions upgrade, increasing their strength.

  Minions deal 50% reduced damage to enemy champions.

  The armor of turrets is reduced when enemy minions are nearby.

  Minions start with 325 movement speed and gain 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 (based on minutes) movement speed as the game progresses.

  New spawning minions level up based on their team's average level (e.g. one level 15, 10 and 18 would make a minion level 14).

  Destroying an enemy inhibitor provides a small buff to allied minions in the lane where the inhibitor was destroyed.

  The team with the higher average champion level gains the minion pushing buff. The buff increases the minion damage against enemy minions and reduces the damage they take from them. This buff starts to apply at 3:30. Minions who are already spawned will still gain the buff and the values will update for all minions when the level and turret advantages change.

  Auto-attacks against enemy champions will draw minion aggro.

**Intro:** 
  As a new player, it can be intimidating to play lane. I don't mean queuing up for the role or sitting far back in the lane but actually interacting with the minions and your lane opponent. This is due to the fear of making mistakes, and thus falling far behind with no help. My goal is to make playing the lane less scary by building an understanding of the mechanics of the lane and solid fundamentals. If done right, even when you fall behind from mistakes, you won't panic because you have a plan and the fundamentals to fall back on. 

  To make things simple, let's break the lane down into two parts; farming and trading. 
  
  **1) Farming:**
    Farming will be the base of your gameplay. Everything you do in lane should revolve around either killing your minions or denying your enemy from farming their minions. To start, focus on farming your own minions (as you become more consistent at this part you can move on to denying). Gold and xp are the most important resources in league, and your main source will be minions (kills are a much less consistent source). A minion wave has 3 melee minions, 3 caster minions, and every few waves has 1 cannon minion. (every 3rd wave till 15m. every other wave till 25m. Then every wave.) Melee minions are worth 21g, caster minions are worth 14g, and cannon minions are worth 60g (90g by 17m15s). To save you from doing the math it's 105g each non cannon wave and 165g (to 195g) on cannon waves. Let's show an example: 
      At 15m, Ahri has 120cs while Brand has 80cs. To keep things simple let's assume they have the same amount of cannon minions taken. Averaging out the melee and caster gold value to 17.5g, that gives Ahri a 700g advantage! That's more than 2 kills (kills = 300g assuming not first blood or bounty). If Ahri also has a level lead (some complex math due to how each champion scales) then her effective gold lead would be closer to 1100 which is the value of a complete sorcery shoes! All this from farming effectively.
    Now how do we actually farm effectively. In the assignments section (or searching on youtube / google) there will be guides to csing but my belief is that 1v1s vs another person gives the best focused and targeted training for csing due to how it simulates real games. We apply the same steps outline in <champions> and write down why you missed each minion. That will give you a few categories to work from. 

  **2) Trading:**
    This section I will assume you have a solid understanding of farming (consistently hit 7cs/m average for the first 15m). The key to trading is knowing what both champions can do and their limits. If I'm playing Ahri vs Veigar and he misses his cage ability then I know for 20s (rank 1 cd) that I can play aggressive vs him without him being able to punish (his abilities are easier to dodge if you aren't cc'd). The inverse is true if I miss a charm (my cc ability), then for 14s he can play aggressive if he chooses to. Expand this to each ability you have and add in mana and health pools as resources. That's all trading is! Another example is if my ability does 80 damage and his does 70 dmg. Then if we both hit each other, I win out! If my auto range is longer and I can auto him twice while he can only auto once, I win out! These small wins build up to solo kills, a cs lead, tower plates, ect once you know how to identify them then capitalize. 

    But when do I trade? Great question! For beginners I suggest to focus on if they use an ability to farm minions. This is a very simple way of punishing cooldowns (they won't be able to trade back). Then you can expand to watching when the enemy champion last hit minions and punish them for their auto attack being on cool down (yes these have cooldowns just much shorter than an ability). After lv 6 you punish them when you have your ultimate off cooldown and they don't. Keep it simple, most of trading is trial and error (lots of error i.e. mistakes which is good to learn from!)

    Now hopefully you see why farming comes first. To effectively trade you need to be able to focus on the enemy champion and think about their moves. This is much harder to do (if not impossible) if you are focused on your champion, what your champion can do, and trying to hit minions. 

**You are ready to Lane!**
  You can farm and know how to trade. Now it's time to play the lane! The next important concepts are positioning and wave manipulation. There is endless depth to these concepts so this part will just be the most simplified version I can make. Let's start with an example. 
    I'm playing Ahri vs Veigar, and start the 1st wave of the game by using my orb on the minions. Veigar doesn't have a waveclear ability to match my push this early so the wave will start advancing towards his tower. This push continues unless he is able to stop it (which since I have control over by having better waveclear, he cannot) or it hits the tower. After hitting his tower, the wave will bounce (fancy way of saying it comes back towards my tower). Now I make the choice to let the wave come back towards me, which I like to call pulling (opposite of push). The wave pulls towards my tower until it either hits the tower or I hold the wave. If it hits the tower it will bounce again towards his tower and ping pong back and forth. 

  That's it! Each game will be versions of this. A very general rule is you look for trades when the wave is pushing and avoid trades when it's pulling (The reasoning for this is simple if you think about it. Trading cost resources. If you trade when the wave is pulling towards you, you put yourself at less resources which you need to farm the minions. This is very general because there will be cases, normally when you are stronger, where you want to trade when the wave is pulling since you can freeze). Try to crash the wave if it's closer to your opponent's tower and hold it when it's close to your tower. 

  **Warding & Jungle Tracking**
      To keep this section simple, look for wards after you crash a wave into the enemy tower. Ward the side that your jungler ISN'T on or if you have info on the enemy jungler then put it where he is likely to go. Most issues with being ganked come from pushing as the jungler is pathing towards your lane. 

**Next Steps**
  As you learn the role YOU WILL MAKE TONS OF MISTAKES AND FALL BEHIND IN THESE GAMES. This is OK AND EXPECTED. The goal isn't to play mistake free but to make many mistakes and learn from them. Fell down 2 lvs to a Yone? In the op.gg, look at exactly when you started to fall behind in xp and go to that time in the vod review. Now you can see that you failed a roam bot lane and lost 4 waves and 2 tower plates mid lane. 
  
  You've been doing great so far, putting the time in! but, you feel stuck. Now is the time to reflect and write down your current problems or any questions you have. THIS IS WHEN YOU ASK FOR COACHING. Ask questions about the problem, don't just ask for the solution. Know what the problem is, and ask questions that ask why or how the problem occurs. Try to break it down into simpler parts. If you still don't understand then ask for help. 

  Once you feel ready, move on to your respective role guide.
