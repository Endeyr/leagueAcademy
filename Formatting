Feel free to use links, videos, images, ect in supporting your argument (learning objective). 
Make the goals realistic and object based. 
Remember the audience! Create your content for new players (silver and below). 
The simpler the better. 
Ask and answer the Whys?, Whens? and Hows?. Why do something, when to do it, and how.
