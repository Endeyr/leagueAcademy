Information D2+ laners need to know 

**Advanced lane manipulation:** (needs edited)
	building / holding waves when  you don't need priority
  win trades -> resource adv -> deny resources -> relieve pressure w/ jng or sup -> small wins to big wins 
  Using aggression to protect the wave is better than matching wave clear 
  need to be confident (need to try and fail) 
  call for jg assistance when building / holding waves
  sacrificing early farm for xp leads is always worth
  position across if outranged, same side if range adv
